    <h1>Object of the Game</h1>
    <p>Each player assumes the role of either a Human or Alien. The Humans are trying to save themselves by reaching the
        Escape Pods. The Aliens seek to hunt down all the Humans.</p>
    <p>Each player's identity and position is kept secret; You will need to interpret their movement and behaviour to
        discover who and what they really are!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each <span class="human-text">Human</span> player acts alone, trying to be the first to reach one of the
            Escape Pods</li>
        <li>The <span class="alien-text">Aliens</span> must work together to intercept and kill the <span
                class="human-text">Humans</span> before they reach an Escape Pod</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the beginning of the game you don't know what side the other players are on! You will need to deduce their
        identity by watching their actions. Your team can be seen by hovering over the card in the top-righthand corner
        of your screen.</p>

    <h1>The Map</h1>
    <p>Each game will take place on one of the maps available <a href="/maps">here</a> and will look something like
        this:</p>
    <div class="image-container" style="height: 500px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/examplemap.png" />
    </div>
    <p>A grid of hexagons has been
        placed to control movement. Each hexagon is called a <a href="/compendium/dictionary#sector">Sector</a> and
        every
        Sector is identified by a unique letter & number combination</p>
    <p>Sectors are colored differently based on what type of Sector they are, and each type will be explained in the
        below.</p>

    <h1>Game Turns</h1>
    <p>The game is played over a series of rounds. During each round, each player must move his or her character. Your
        character type determines the distance they can move:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="human-text">Humans</span> move only <span style="color: orange">ONE</span> sector</li>
        <li><span class="alien-text">Aliens</span> move <span style="color: orange">ONE or TWO</span> sectors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your location is marked by a <span style="color: gold">Gold</span> sector. On your turn, your available moves
        will be outlined in <span style="color: gold">Gold</span> as well. Unless otherwise noted, you can
        never end your turn in the same sector your started in. <span style="color: orange">YOU MUST MOVE EVERY
            ROUND</span></p>

    <h2>Types of Sectors</h2>
    <p>There are 5 different types of Sectors. After moving, the type of Sector you moved into determines what happens
        next:</p>

    <h3 style="color: white">Safe Sector</h3>
    <p>Safe Sectors are marked in <span style="color: white">White</span>. If you move into a Safe Sector, you
        will make no noise.</p>

    <h3 style="color: grey">Dangerous Sector</h3>
    <p>Dangerous Sectors are marked in <span style="color: gray">Gray</span>. If you move into a Dangerous Sector, you
        will draw a card. Depending on what card is drawn, you will make noise accordingly. This is explained more
        below.
    </p>

    <h3 class="human-text">Human Sector</h3>
    <p>Human Sectors are marked in <span class="human-text">Blue</span>. This is where <span
            class="human-text">Human</span> players start - if
        there are multiple Human Sectors, <span class="human-text">Humans</span> will be randomly placed in one of them
        at the beginning of the game.
        Players cannot move into or through these Sectors.
    </p>

    <h3 class="alien-text">Alien Sector</h3>
    <p>Alien Sectors are marked in <span class="alien-text">Red</span>. This is where <span
            class="alien-text">Alien</span> players start - if there are
        multiple Alien Sectors, <span class="alien-text">Aliens</span> will be randomly placed in one of them at the
        beginning of the game. Players
        cannot move into or through these Sectors.</p>

    <h3 style="color: forestgreen">Escape Pod Sectors</h3>
    <p>Escape Pods are marked in <span style="color: forestgreen">Green</span>. <span class="human-text">Humans</span>
        must end their turn in one of
        these Sectors to win. Only <span class="human-text">Humans</span> can move into these Sectors. These are
        explained more below.</p>

    <h2>Dangerous Sectors</h2>
    <p>If you move into a Dangerous Sector, you will draw a <a href="/compendium/cards">Card</a>. There are 4 main types
        of
        cards you might draw:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4 style="color: red">Red "Noise In Your Sector" Cards</h4>
            <p>If you draw a Red Card, you will make noise in the Sector you just moved into.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 style="color: forestgreen">Green "Noise In Any Sector" Cards</h4>
            <p>If you draw a Green Card, you may pick any Sector on the map to make noise in.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 style="color: white">White "Silence" Cards</h4>
            <p>If you draw a White Card, you will avoid making any noise on that turn.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 style="color: white">White "Item" Cards</h4>
            <p>If you draw an Item card, you will avoid making any noise that turn. Additionally, if you're a <span
                    class="human-text">Human</span>, you will add that Item
                to your hand, which
                is shown at the bottom of the screen. Cards can be used at any point on your turn after you've drawn
                them, including <em>on</em> the turn you draw the Item. <span class="alien-text">Alien</span> Players
                cannot receive Item cards and will discard them. For an explanation of
                what each Item card does, you can hover over
                that card in your hand, or check out <a href="/compendium/cards#item-cards">the Card page in the
                    Compendium</a>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In any game, before it starts, the Host can adjust how many of each card is active in the game.</p>

    <h2>Attacking</h2>
    <p><span class="alien-text">Alien</span> Players may decide to attack at the end of his or her turn. After moving,
        you will be asked if you'd like
        to attack the Sector you just moved into. If you select "No", your turn will continue as normal. If you select
        "Yes", the following will happen:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You will not draw any cards this turn, regardless of what type of Sector you just moved into.</li>
        <li>It will be announced that you are attacking the Sector you just moved into.</li>
        <li>Any other players in that Sector are immediately killed, <span style="color: orange">regardless of whether
                they are Human or Alien.</span></li>
        <li><span class="human-text">Humans</span> that are killed will respawn on their next turn as an <span
                class="alien-text">Alien</span> in an Alien Start Sector. Killed <span class="alien-text">Aliens</span>
            are (by default) permanently killed and will become a Spectator. The Host has an option to change this,
            instead letting killed <span class="alien-text">Aliens</span> respawn as well.</li>
        <li>If an <span class="alien-text">Alien</span> kills a <span class="human-text">Human</span>, that <span
                class="alien-text">Alien</span> will be given the <a
                href="/compendium/statusEffects#hyperphagic">Hyperphagic</a> Status Effect. This will allow you to move
            1 extra space every turn for the rest of the game. This bonus does not increase if an <span
                class="alien-text">Alien</span> kills multiple
            <span class="human-text">Humans</span>.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Character Roles</h1>
    <p>Character Roles give each player unique abilities for you to use in the game. Players do not have to reveal their
        Role at any point, so feel free to keep it a secret if it benefits you! In any game, before it starts, the Host
        has control over which roles are active, how many of each role can be in the game, and whether any roles should
        be guaranteed to be in the game.</p>
    <p>For an explanation of each role, see <a href="/compendium/roles">that page in the Compendium</a></p>

    <h1>Escape Pods</h1>
    <p>When a <span class="human-text">Human</span> player ends their turn in one of the Escape Pods, the following will
        happen:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>That player will draw one of the Escape Pod cards to see if it's functional. By default, there are 4
            "Working Pod" cards and 1 "Broken Pod" card. The number of working vs.
            broken Escape Pod cards can be set by the Host before the game starts.</li>
        <li>If the pod is working, that player has successfully escaped! They will be removed from the board and the
            player will be placed on the Spectator team</li>
        <li>If the pod is broken, the pod is damaged and doesn't work. That player will need to find a different Escape
            Pod.</li>
        <li>Regardless of whether the pod is working or broken, it can no longer be used by anyone in the game. It will
            be marked in <span style="color: brown">Brown</span> to signify it can no longer be used.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>The End of the Game</h1>
    <p>The game ends after 40 turns (by default - the Host can adjust this value) or when there are no Human players
        remaining.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any <span class="human-text">Human</span> that successfully escaped wins!</li>
        <li>The <span class="alien-text">Aliens</span> win if they kill the last <span class="human-text">Human</span>
            on board.</li>
        <li>If the set number of turns have elapsed, the ship runs out of air. Any remaining <span
                class="human-text">Humans</span> suffocate and the
            <span class="alien-text">Aliens</span> win!
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>That should be everything! Above all, <span style="color: orange">Remember: This is a game of bluff and guile.
            You are very much encouraged to chat with the other players during the game, discussing strategies, making
            accusations, and ideally pretending to be part of the opposing team!</span></p>
