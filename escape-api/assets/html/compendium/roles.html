    <h1 id="vanilla-roles">Vanilla Roles</h1>
    <p>These roles were ported as closely as the phyiscal version of the game as I could/was willing to do. Since many
        Roles gave the player a one-time use ability, most of them
        were tweaked to either give a Status Effect or a Card at the beginning of the game for ease of implementation,
        but the end result should be roughly the same. Cards that are given as a result of being assigned a role are
        <em>not</em> placed in the Discard Pile after being used, to avoid disrupting the balance of the Deck. Roles
        that have been changed from the tabletop version are marked with an asterisk (*)

    <h2 id="alien-roles">Alien Roles</h2>
    <p>Roles given to Players on the Alien Team. In the tabletop version, many of the Alien roles feel (to me) quite
        underwhelming, so for any Alien whose Role allowed them to use a certain card, I've adjusted them to start with
        1 of those cards, but they cannot draw any more. Hopefully, this will bring them in line with the Human Roles
    </p>

    <p>You start with 1 <a href="/compendium/cards#teleport">Teleport</a> card. I am aware of how broken this currently
        is, it's a side effect of the way I've adjusted Alien Roles and I'm working on balancing it.</p>
