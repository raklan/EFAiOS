        <h1>Cards</h1>
        <p>All players draw a card upon entering a Dangerous Sector. Depending on what type of card it is, you will make
                some sort of noise, then either discard it (if it's a noise card) or keep it. (if it's an Item card and
                the player is a Human)</p>

                that have been considerably changed from the tabletop version are marked with an asterisk (*) and the
                exact changes are <em>italicized</em>. In general, any card that doesn't have an immediate effect (like
                Attack, for example) will now give a <a href="/compendium/statuseffects">Status Effect</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="noise-cards">Noise Cards</h2>

                cards and will discard all Item cards after drawing them.</p>
